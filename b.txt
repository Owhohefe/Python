Linux Basics for Hackers started with “what is ethical hacking” and then moved on to setting up a Kali virtual machine on VirtualBox.  From there, I was given a brief overview of the Linux file system and shown how to use basic Linux commands.  The book expected me to follow along with the examples given, and every chapter ended with exercises to reinforce learning and retention.  Everything that really matters was covered: key commands, file manipulation, networking, managing and installing software, permissions, managing processes, etc.  
Linux Basics for Hackers covered both Bash Scripting and Python. I got to build simple yet useful tools instead of learning a lot of theory. I did find the Python and Bash Scripting section a little inadequate but it is left for me to enroll for training and read other books to get better knowledge. Linux Basics also covered MySQL database and wireless hacking.
On the whole, I really enjoyed the book. It’s great from the way OccupyTheWeb authored it as a good introduction to Linux for those looking to venture into cyber security. He covered topics in enough detail to make them useful examples without going so deep as to bore the reader by focusing for too long on any one task. He managed to squeeze a lot of information into a very manageable read. At only 211 pages, he covered the basics of the operating system in enough detail that the reader can immediately put the knowledge into hands-on practice and begin to develop proficiency with Linux.
